## Hi there 👋

I'm Ervin, an aspiring Software Engineer based in Sydney, Australia. 

I like looking at code and building stuff with it since it just facinates me. I'm currently working on building my portfolio with creating little applications here and there to demonstrate my skills. 

So far, my main tech stack is Java, Python, and C++. (Very basic I know hahaha). I use visual studio code as my main IDE. 

## Fun facts

* I'm really into drinking coffee.
* Sword Art Online is my favourite anime.
* My hobbies are going outside to eat (i.e being a foodie), reaing light novels, cooking, HSR and Genshin, Gym.+
